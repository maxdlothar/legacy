			<P>Welcome to the launch of Inform's Excellence Drive, our next step
			in galvanising Inform to meet the challenges of the future.</p>

			<P>The purpose of this initiative is to provide all our team with
			the right support, training and tools to assist in the successful
			growth of our business going forward.  We are pleased to welcome
			on board Jo Haythornthwaite who will be helping to make these
			things happen.</p>

			<P>Jo is both highly qualified and experienced in working in the
			market place and her skills and abilities, I hope, will be much
			appreciated and will help us all to achieve the key objectives
			and targets we want to realise from this.</p>

			<P>We see, in going forward, you, our team members, as the most valued
			asset in the company to make this happen and enable the ongoing
			security and expansion of the business. A strong business will
			provide all of us with the peace of mind and security for the
			future we all want and need.</p>

			<P>Some of the areas we wish to work on together are:
			<ul>
				<li>Individual training plans for all of you.</li>

				<li>Training to assist you in your daily work.</li>

				<li>Regular reviews to build your competencies and abilities,
					enabling you to grow your skills and talents.</li>

				<li>Regular team meetings to keep you informed of how we are
					doing and giving you the opportunity to feedback to us the
					things that can improve our business and take us forward.</li>

				<li>Complete review of all procedures and processes to
					document and make available electronically.</li>

				<li>Improved communications, both verbal and written.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<P>Jo’s first day here was on Monday, 5th March 2007 and she will be
			in the office two days a week. Listed below are dates for the next
			month. She will commence one-to-ones
			with all of you to give you the opportunity to provide
			constructive comments that will assist this exciting initiative
			which I am sure we all want to be successful. Your role in this
			is critical and I do encourage all of you to be as committed as
			you can so we can really make a difference and improve our business.</p>

			<p>Details will be posted weekly on our local Intranet so you can
			see what we have done, what we are doing and what is planned.
			Various Projects will also be launched and there will be project
			leaders assisting Jo in the successful completion of these. We
			aim to start with Administration in the office and the creation
			of a central filing system.</p>

			<p>We are very excited, as I am sure you all are about these new
			initiatives and look forward to your support and participation
			in making this a success.</p>
